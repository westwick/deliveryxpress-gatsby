Close the door, put out the light
No, they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know?
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through, oh
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They hold no quarter, oh
Walking side-by-side with death
The devil mocks their every step, ooh
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you, oh, oh, oh
They choose the path where no one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
Yeah
Without quarter, quarter, yeah (without quarter)
Without quarter, quarter, quarter
Taking no quarter
Oh, oh, oh (hear the dogs of doom) (no, never quarter)
I hear the dogs of doom are howling more
