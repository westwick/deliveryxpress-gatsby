Here's to the one with the smoking stare

Running through my head with a bolo knife

Chopping up the threads made up from looms

Of love and blood and hate and some empty tunes

Eyes killer cold and black and bare

Freaky little tooth hanging solo

Sucking at the walls like a rolo now

Making a cocoon when my brain fits

# I wanna go back

1. I wanna go back
2. I wanna go back with a club and attack
3. I wanna take to my guns and break you
4. I gotta make my little foe take his own
5. I wanna go back, I wanna go back
6. I wanna go back with a club and attack
7. I wanna take to my guns and break you
8. I gotta make my little foe take his own

I've overgrown with a yellow mold

Just fizzing drones in a hollow dome

My funny nose dripping little groans

I'm so so cold in the marrow of my bones

I look at you as you take a snooze

Your skinny lips dripping rabid goo

I lift your chin and I grin at you

As you come to, man

I'm running round your head with a bolo knife

# I'm gonna go back

I'm gonna go back

I'm gonna go back to a face, no more mask

I was in full bloom until I met you

I'm gonna shake my fetters I'm breaking loose

* I'm gonna go back
* I'm gonna go back

I'm gonna go back to a face, no more mask

I was in full bloom until I met you

I'm gonna shake my fetters I'm breaking loose

* I'm gonna go back
* I'm gonna go back

I'm gonna go back to a face, no more mask

I was in full bloom until I met you

I'm gonna shake my fetters I'm breaking loose
